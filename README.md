As I worked through this excercise I used a series of prompts that asked the player to choose a number from 1 to 10. Each time the user chose a number, that number was compared to a random number the computer chose using the Math.floor(Math.random( * 10) command. I was a little bit confused at first about how I could build a game with any substance with such simple commands. After some deep thought about how to go about it I realized that the possibilites are endless. Seeing what can be done with very little excites me about what can be done with more complex programs.
